> Problem Statement 1: Drone Altitude Stabilization

---

## The Problem
Urban delivery drones and inspection UAVs face sudden wind gusts 
that destabilize altitude. Without proper control, a 0.5N wind gust 
causes dangerous oscillations that take seconds to recover from — 
or never recover at all.

**HoverGuard** is a PID-based altitude stabilization system that 
rejects wind disturbances and recovers to target altitude in under 
3 seconds.

## System Model
G(s) = 1 / (s² + 2s + 5)
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Natural frequency ωn | 2.236 rad/s |
| Damping ratio ζ | 0.447 (underdamped) |
| Open-loop poles | -1 ± 2i |
| Disturbance | 0.5N wind at t = 5s |

---

## Our Approach
We used **analytical pole placement** to design the PID controller 
rather than trial-and-error tuning:

1. Set target damping ratio ζ = 0.7 (ensures overshoot < 10%)
2. Set target settling time < 3s → minimum σ = 4/3 = 1.33
3. Derived desired closed-loop pole locations
4. Used MATLAB `pidtune` validated against manual calculations
5. Verified performance using `stepinfo` metrics

## Controller Performance

| Metric | Requirement | Achieved |
|---|---|---|
| Overshoot | < 10% | 3.35% ✓ |
| Settling time | < 3s | 2.48s ✓ |
| Steady-state error | ≈ 0 | < 0.001 ✓ |
| Disturbance rejection | Stable | ✓ |

**Final PID Gains:**
- Kp = 10.2543
- Ki = 13.1422  
- Kd = 1.9336
